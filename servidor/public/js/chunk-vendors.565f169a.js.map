Each instance of the API class has\n\t * a \"context\" - i.e. the tables that it will operate on. This could be a single\n\t * table, all tables on a page or a sub-set thereof.\n\t *\n\t * Additionally the API is designed to allow you to easily work with the data in\n\t * the tables, retrieving and manipulating it as required. This is done by\n\t * presenting the API class as an array like interface. The contents of the\n\t * array depend upon the actions requested by each method (for example\n\t * `rows().nodes()` will return an array of nodes, while `rows().data()` will\n\t * return an array of objects or arrays depending upon your table's\n\t * configuration). The API object has a number of array like methods (`push`,\n\t * `pop`, `reverse` etc) as well as additional helper methods (`each`, `pluck`,\n\t * `unique` etc) to assist your working with the data held in a table.\n\t *\n\t * Most methods (those which return an Api instance) are chainable, which means\n\t * the return from a method call also has all of the methods available that the\n\t * top level object had. For example, these two calls are equivalent:\n\t *\n\t *     // Not chained\n\t *     api.row.add( {...} );\n\t *     api.draw();\n\t *\n\t *     // Chained\n\t *     api.row.add( {...} ).draw();\n\t *\n\t * @class DataTable.Api\n\t * @param {array|object|string|jQuery} context DataTable identifier. This is\n\t *   used to define which DataTables enhanced tables this API will operate on.\n\t *   Can be one of:\n\t *\n\t *   * `string` - jQuery selector. Any DataTables' matching the given selector\n\t *     with be found and used.\n\t *   * `node` - `TABLE` node which has already been formed into a DataTable.\n\t *   * `jQuery` - A jQuery object of `TABLE` nodes.\n\t *   * `object` - DataTables settings object\n\t * @param {array} [data] Data to initialise the Api instance with.\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t *   // Direct initialisation during DataTables construction\n\t *   var api = $('#example').DataTable();\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t *   // Initialisation using a DataTables jQuery object\n\t *   var api = $('#example').dataTable().api();\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t *   // Initialisation as a constructor\n\t *   var api = new $.fn.DataTable.Api( 'table.dataTable' );\n\t */\n\t_Api = function ( context, data )\n\t{\n\t\tif ( !

DataTables has a number of default parameters which\n\t\t * you can override using this option. Please refer to the jQuery\n\t\t * documentation for a full description of the options available, although\n\t\t * the following parameters provide additional options in DataTables or\n\t\t * require special consideration:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * * `data` - As with jQuery, `data` can be provided as an object, but it\n\t\t *   can also be used as a function to manipulate the data DataTables sends\n\t\t *   to the server. The function takes a single parameter, an object of\n\t\t *   parameters with the values that DataTables has readied for sending. An\n\t\t *   object may be returned which will be merged into the DataTables\n\t\t *   defaults, or you can add the items to the object that was passed in and\n\t\t *   not return anything from the function. This supersedes `fnServerParams`\n\t\t *   from DataTables 1.9-.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * * `dataSrc` - By default DataTables will look for the property `data` (or\n\t\t *   `aaData` for compatibility with DataTables 1.9-) when obtaining data\n\t\t *   from an Ajax source or for server-side processing - this parameter\n\t\t *   allows that property to be changed. You can use Javascript dotted\n\t\t *   object notation to get a data source for multiple levels of nesting, or\n\t\t *   it my be used as a function. As a function it takes a single parameter,\n\t\t *   the JSON returned from the server, which can be manipulated as\n\t\t *   required, with the returned value being that used by DataTables as the\n\t\t *   data source for the table. This supersedes `sAjaxDataProp` from\n\t\t *   DataTables 1.9-.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * * `success` - Should not be overridden it is used internally in\n\t\t *   DataTables. To manipulate / transform the data returned by the server\n\t\t *   use `ajax.dataSrc`, or use `ajax` as a function (see below).\n\t\t *\n\t\t * `function`\n\t\t * ----------\n\t\t *\n\t\t * As a function, making the Ajax call is left up to yourself allowing\n\t\t * complete control of the Ajax request.

The\n\t\t * parameters are:\n\t\t *\n\t\t * 1. _object_ - Data to send to the server\n\t\t * 2. _function_ - Callback function that must be executed when the required\n\t\t *    data has been obtained.

This is the\n\t\t *   default that DataTables uses (incrementally increased for each column).\n\t\t * * `string` - read an object property from the data source. There are\n\t\t *   three 'special' options that can be used in the string to alter how\n\t\t *   DataTables reads the data from the source object:\n\t\t *    * `.` - Dotted Javascript notation. Just as you use a `.` in\n\t\t *      Javascript to read from nested objects, so to can the options\n\t\t *      specified in `data`. For example: `browser.version` or\n\t\t *      `browser.name`. If your object parameter name contains a period, use\n\t\t *      `\\\\` to escape it - i.e. `first\\\\.name`.\n\t\t *    * `[]` - Array notation. DataTables can automatically combine data\n\t\t *      from and array source, joining the data with the characters provided\n\t\t *      between the two brackets. For example: `name[, ]` would provide a\n\t\t *      comma-space separated list from the source array. If no characters\n\t\t *      are provided between the brackets, the original array source is\n\t\t *      returned.\n\t\t *    * `()` - Function notation. Adding `()` to the end of a parameter will\n\t\t *      execute a function of the name given. For example: `browser()` for a\n\t\t *      simple function on the data source, `browser.version()` for a\n\t\t *      function in a nested property or even `browser().version` to get an\n\t\t *      object property if the function called returns an object. Note that\n\t\t *      function notation is recommended for use in `render` rather than\n\t\t *      `data` as it is much simpler to use as a renderer.\n\t\t * * `null` - use the original data source for the row rather than plucking\n\t\t *   data directly from it. This action has effects on two other\n\t\t *   initialisation options:\n\t\t *    * `defaultContent` - When null is given as the `data` option and\n\t\t *      `defaultContent` is specified for the column, the value defined by\n\t\t *      `defaultContent` will be used for the cell.\n\t\t *    * `render` - When null is used for the `data` option and the `render`\n\t\t *      option is specified for the column, the whole data source for the\n\t\t *      row is used for the renderer.\n\t\t * * `function` - the function given will be executed whenever DataTables\n\t\t *   needs to set or get the data for a cell in the column. The function\n\t\t *   takes three parameters:\n\t\t *    * Parameters:\n\t\t *      * `{array|object}` The data source for the row\n\t\t *      * `{string}` The type call data requested - this will be 'set' when\n\t\t *        setting data or 'filter', 'display', 'type', 'sort' or undefined\n\t\t *        when gathering data. Note that when `undefined` is given for the\n\t\t *        type DataTables expects to get the raw data for the object back<\n\t\t *      * `{*}` Data to set when the second parameter is 'set'.\n\t\t *    * Return:\n\t\t *      * The return value from the function is not required when 'set' is\n\t\t *        the type of call, but otherwise the return is what will be used\n\t\t *        for the data requested.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Note that `data` is a getter and setter option. If you just require\n\t\t * formatting of data for output, you will likely want to use `render` which\n\t\t * is simply a getter and thus simpler to use.\n\t\t *\n\t\t * Note that prior to DataTables 1.9.2 `data` was called `mDataProp`. The\n\t\t * name change reflects the flexibility of this property and is consistent\n\t\t * with the naming of mRender. If 'mDataProp' is given, then it will still\n\t\t * be used by DataTables, as it automatically maps the old name to the new\n\t\t * if required.\n\t\t *\n\t\t *  @type string|int|function|null\n\t\t *  @default null <i>Use automatically calculated column index</i>\n\t\t *\n\t\t *  @name DataTable.defaults.column.data\n\t\t *  @dtopt Columns\n\t\t *\n\t\t *  @example\n\t\t *    // Read table data from objects\n\t\t *    // JSON structure for each row:\n\t\t *    //   {\n\t\t *    //      \"engine\": {value},\n\t\t *    //      \"browser\": {value},\n\t\t *    //      \"platform\": {value},\n\t\t *    //      \"version\": {value},\n\t\t *    //      \"grade\": {value}\n\t\t *    //   }\n\t\t *    $(document).ready( function() {\n\t\t *      $('#example').dataTable( {\n\t\t *        \"ajaxSource\": \"sources/objects.txt\",\n\t\t *        \"columns\": [\n\t\t *          { \"data\": \"engine\" },\n\t\t *          { \"data\": \"browser\" },\n\t\t *          { \"data\": \"platform\" },\n\t\t *          { \"data\": \"version\" },\n\t\t *          { \"data\": \"grade\" }\n\t\t *        ]\n\t\t *      } );\n\t\t *    } );\n\t\t *\n\t\t *  @example\n\t\t *    // Read information from deeply nested objects\n\t\t *    // JSON structure for each row:\n\t\t *    //   {\n\t\t *    //      \"engine\": {value},\n\t\t *    //      \"browser\": {value},\n\t\t *    //      \"platform\": {\n\t\t *    //         \"inner\": {value}\n\t\t *    //      },\n\t\t *    //      \"details\": [\n\t\t *    //         {value}, {value}\n\t\t *    //      ]\n\t\t *    //   }\n\t\t *    $(document).ready( function() {\n\t\t *      $('#example').dataTable( {\n\t\t *        \"ajaxSource\": \"sources/deep.txt\",\n\t\t *        \"columns\": [\n\t\t *          { \"data\": \"engine\" },\n\t\t *          { \"data\": \"browser\" },\n\t\t *          { \"data\": \"platform.inner\" },\n\t\t *          { \"data\": \"details.0\" },\n\t\t *          { \"data\": \"details.1\" }\n\t\t *        ]\n\t\t *      } );\n\t\t *    } );\n\t\t *\n\t\t *  @example\n\t\t *    // Using `data` as a function to provide different information for\n\t\t *    // sorting, filtering and display.
